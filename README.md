Machine learning is the field that uses statistics to create computer programs which access data to identify patterns and make predictions on new (unseen) data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the subfield which is concerned with "teaching" machines how to understand language by generally using texts as data.

While significant progress has been made, understanding the human language remains a complex task. It is generally simple for humans to acquire language through different interactions in society. However, it is hard to write computer programs which process sentences and grasp the contextual information of sentences. In this repository, I explore how to use transformers for two main tasks (text summarizing and question answering). The transformer that I am currently working on is BERT.
