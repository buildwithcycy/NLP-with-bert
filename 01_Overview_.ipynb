        "Machine learning is the field that uses statistics to create computer programs which access data to identify patterns and make predictions on new (unseen) data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the subfield which is concerned with \"teaching\" machines how to understand language by generally using texts as data.</br> </br> While significant progress has been made, understanding the human language remains a complex task. It is generally simple for humans to acquire language through different interactions in society. However, it is hard to write computer programs which process sentences and grasp the contextual information of sentences.  "

The four data points are the *current month of the year*, the *rainfall quantity*, the *prices of fertilizers*, and the *variety of the tomates to grow*). Alex travels to a rural city and collects information from local farmers over a period of year (A great vacation for him, of course). The data that he has collected is called historical data and Alex uses it to build a simple network to predict the best period to grow tomatoes.\n",

        "These four data points can be used to build a simple network which can predict the best period to grow tomatoes. <br/> However, Alex realizes that the users of his farming bot will actually be asking questions such as \"It looked pretty sunny in the last few weeks, is it a good time to grow cherry tomatoes ?\"...Right. This is getting complex. Alex has to write a program which understands the meaning of each word in a given sentence  (e.g. a tomato = plant) and the importance of certain words in formulating an answer (e.g. sunny weather). This program also has to understand how words follow each other in a sentence. When we see a sentence ending in \"good time to grow...\", we can expect that the next word will be a name, specifically, the name of an organism, a plant, a city, or even a business. Human brains are very good at understanding the context in a sentence. By paying attention to the conversation, we can guess that the next word may be related to farming. \n",

        "Fortunately, Alex knows he can store a dictionnary to indicate the direct meaning of a word. However, he is not certain on how to approach understanding the sequence of words nor paying attention to context. Fortunately, Alex  meets a machine learning scientist who tells him about other types of networks: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs).\n",
